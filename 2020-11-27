He soon proves that the tiniest offense can indeed snowball into complete lawlessness!  The Allergy: Gumball needs to find a cure for Darwin's allergy before he sneezes Elmore off the map. Darwin starts sneezing repeatedly and it seems he can't stop. The Wattersons figure maybe he's allergic to something.

        "summary_long": "The Kids: Gumball and Darwin's voices may be breaking, but they're showing no signs of growing up. Whilst Gumball and Darwin make fun of Mom and Dad for being old, their voices start to break. They try to ignore it, but everybody they meet reacts to their new and unpredictable voices. Gumball and Darwin finally decide to make the most of their childhood whilst there's still time.  The Fan: Sarah, the new kid in school, is Gumball and Darwin's number one, slightly obsessive, fan. Sarah is intensely following Gumball and Darwin around trying to win their friendship.  When Gumball tells her that she is acting like a stalker, she embraces it and actually takes it up a notch.  However, when Gumball and Darwin realise that she's behaving this way because she's lonely, they go to surprising lengths to make her feel accepted.",

When Gumball and Darwin see Anton the next day, as good as new, they set out to discover his secret. It turns out that his parents use a special formula to bake new Antons when necessary. So the kids test it out at home and end up baking a clone army whose leader - Ant-one - wants to destroy Anton and take over the world.  The Puppy: The kids finally get the puppy they always wanted, except . . . it's actually a turtle, and it hates them. After begging Dad for a puppy, the kids are taken aback when he comes home with a turtle.
