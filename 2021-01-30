Whilst Gumball and Darwin make fun of Mom and Dad for being old, their voices start to break. They try to ignore it, but everybody they meet reacts to their new and unpredictable voices. Gumball and Darwin finally decide to make the most of their childhood whilst there's still time.  The Fan: Sarah, the new kid in school, is Gumball and Darwin's number one, slightly obsessive, fan. Sarah is intensely following Gumball and Darwin around trying to win their friendship.  When Gumball tells her that she is acting like a stalker, she embraces it and actually takes it up a notch.  However, when Gumball and Darwin realise that she's behaving this way because she's lonely, they go to surprising lengths to make her feel accepted.",
