        "summary_long": "Dilly adheres to her original orders and protects Joseph by choosing to fight Yamaji. However, Yamaji's overwhelming strength soon becomes evident. Meanwhile, Higan has a surprise visitor who earnestly pleads with him to put an end to the tragic contradictions of the ninja clan that has remained trapped by history and the code. Over at the FBI offices, Mike has been captured and tries to negotiate with his boss by using his knowledge of the collusion between AUZA and the government as leverage. At the same time, Joseph panics and begins threatening government officials by demanding they follow his orders or he'll trigger thermonuclear explosions across the country by overloading AUZA's reactors. Yamaji gains control of AUZA and begins implementing his new vision for the ninja clan's future. It starts by sending his soldiers equipped with high-tech battle suits to occupy multiple government facilities.",
