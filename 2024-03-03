Meanwhile, Mike and Emma walk away from the accident with light injuries and relaunch their investigation into AUZA and the ninjas. Little do they know, but the AUZA CEO, Joseph, has already forged a partnership with the ninja organization. As it stands, the clan has embraced a new way of operating and hardly resembles how it used to be. In the past, Higan, Mari, and Zai were trained by the clan and showed immense promise as future leaders. However, Higan and Mari broke the ninja code by falling in love, which totally changed their relationship with Zai. Back in the present, Higan infiltrates AUZA City by following a route provided by the mysterious benefactor. But just as Higan is about to breach the last barrier, he is confronted by Zai, aka The Reaper, who foresaw his arrival.",
