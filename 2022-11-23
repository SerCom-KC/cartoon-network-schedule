But when he discovers almost all of them were astronauts, Mike decides there's only one logical explanation: He must be part of a secret government plot to kill astronauts, because of something they saw on the moon, something the government doesn't want us to know! Literally before giving this theory a second thought, Mike steals a rocket and blasts off for the moon. In the end Mike learns from his auto insurer he hasn't been killing astronauts after all. It was a clerical error and most of the deaths were astronomers. And there can't be a secret government plot to kill astronomers, right?",
