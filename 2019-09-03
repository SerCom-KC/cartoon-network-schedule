When Spike gets stuck trying to exit the doghouse, he realizes it's time to back off the beef. Spike orders Tom to hide the tempting T-bones and no matter what he says or does don't let him have them! Of course it's a lose-lose scenario for Tom; Spike becomes angry if Tom caves in to his demands and gives him the steaks and even angrier if he doesn't! When Jerry moves one of the nightly T-bones from Tom's latest hiding place, it begets a series of unfortunate events when Spike's hunger becomes too much and he demands Tom give him his steak back! Jerry enjoys the show and the food (cat and mouse dinner theater). In the end, Spike loses the extra weight from chasing Tom. When Jerry can't fit in his mouse hole because of the weight he's gained justice is served!",
