Jason has a vendetta against AUZA and agrees to help Mike by hacking into one of their websites. Among the data they steal, Mike unexpectedly comes across Emma's name, but AUZA traces the hack and sends mercenaries to shut them down. Elsewhere, after having his first attempt to infiltrate AUZA City stopped by Zai, Higan learns of an alternate route from the mysterious benefactor. Higan chooses to take it, despite knowing that it's a trap, and gets confronted by the ninja organization's lieutenants. The lieutenants are equipped with high-tech battles suits called \"Gusoku Gear\" that give them immense power. The situation looks dire as Higan gets overwhelmed, but before Zai can deliver the final blow, one lieutenant named Aska does something that surprises everyone.",
