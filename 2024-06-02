Jerry's having his way until a pesky fly gets in between Jerry's lust and the cheese he's after. As we know, Jerry's not an unreasonable creature. He breaks off some cheese to share but that's not good enough for the jerk fly! There's a reason why this winged cheese bandit is a loner. He's a great big pest and for the rest of this episode he's going to do his very best to make sure Jerry doesn't get the cheese, including but not limited to, rousting Tom and locking Jerry from the house.",
