Clearly Nicole Watterson is the Best Mom, but Tobias and BJ just won't admit it . . . So they organise a mom-off at the mall between Nicole, Banana Barbara and Jackie Wilson. Needless to say it gets pretty intense.  The Password: Gumball and Darwin are shocked to discover that Anais is Dad's favourite child. Mom has forced Dad to install a password on the computer. The pop-up clue advises them that the password is the name of Dad's favorite child. After trying \"Gumball\" and \"Darwin\" unsuccessfully, they discover the answer is, in fact, \"Anais\". They are determined to become Dad's favorites by any means necessary, even if it means undermining each other, plotting against Anais or driving a wedge between mom and dad . . .",
