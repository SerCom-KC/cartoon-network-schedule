However, after being cornered, Joseph presses the button to explode the AUZA reactors. Thankfully, nothing happens because the signal gets jammed by Jason. The new world order that the ninja organization tries to build comes crumbling down after Yamaji is killed. After the dust settles, Zai tries to go out on his own terms by committing seppuku, but he gets stopped by Higan. Is this the end of all ninjas? Higan casts his Gusoku Gear into the water and disappears to places unknown.",
