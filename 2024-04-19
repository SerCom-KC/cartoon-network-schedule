He makes a house rule, if he can't eat, no one can. Luckily, Jerry and Spike have a stockpile - no skin off their backs. Tom, on the other hand, ain't so lucky. With the cupboards and refrigerator padlocked shut, the overly dramatic Tom cat is left to survive the long cold night on the brink of starvation. That's when he invites Little Quacker for a sleepover and Jerry's plan for a quiet night turns ugly. Fortunately, for the chances of Little Quacker's survival, he's tired of being the nice duck and between Jerry and Little Quacker, Tom's got his work cut out for him. In the end, turns out Rick got his dates wrong and Tom will have to go through this entire thing again next week.",
