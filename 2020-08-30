Gumball is in such a bad mood that it spreads to Darwin, who joins him in complaining about everything. Their constant moaning grabs the attention of the good people of Elmore. Mistaking Gumball and Darwin for genuine kids in need, they put on a benefit and raise money for them. How do Gumball and Darwin confess there's been a mix-up without inciting a riot?!!  The Vacation: The Wattersons set off on a relaxing vacation and end up running for their lives! The Wattersons are swapping scary stories on a family vacation, when their car breaks down in the middle of the desert. They are left with no alternative but to trust a complete stranger, whose appearance matches the scary guy in Mom's story. When the stranger brings them to a derelict gas station, just as he did in mom's made-up scary story, the Wattersons can no longer pretend the story isn't coming true . . .",
