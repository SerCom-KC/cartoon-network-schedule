Tom forces Jerry to take turns playing various games with Tyke (e.g. Checkers, basketball, hopscotch, etc.). Each time they win, Tyke takes it out on them. When Tom and Jerry start throwing the games, Spike's right there to dole out his own punishment for letting Tyke win. Spike, \"I know! We'll play on teams. Me and Tyke against you twos. We'll show the boy how to be a good sport together.\" Sounds good in theory, but when Tom and Jerry beat Spike and Tyke they have double the trouble! Sometimes you just can't win!",

The Vacation: The Wattersons set off on a relaxing vacation and end up running for their lives! The Wattersons are swapping scary stories on a family vacation, when their car breaks down in the middle of the desert. They are left with no alternative but to trust a complete stranger, whose appearance matches the scary guy in Mom's story. When the stranger brings them to a derelict gas station, just as he did in mom's made-up scary story, the Wattersons can no longer pretend the story isn't coming true . . .",
