It turns out that Aska is Emma, a ninja who not only had been sent to infiltrate the ranks of the FBI, but also was the mysterious benefactor that helped Higan. Now that her betrayal of the organization is known, she rushes to prepare a Gusoku Gear for Higan as it's their only hope of fighting back against the ninjas. Aska explains that she had a special relationship with Higan's wife, Mari, and actually tried to help her on the day she died. However, she was only able to save Higan. Meanwhile, Jason saves Mike's life and takes him to a doctor. Mike then learns that he is now wanted by his own agency, the FBI. The ninja lieutenant named Lil finds Aska and Higan's hiding place and attacks them, forcing Aska to fight back. She desperately tries to stall for time until Higan's Gusoku Gear is ready.",
