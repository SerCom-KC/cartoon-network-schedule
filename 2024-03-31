        "summary_long": "The CEO of AUZA, Joseph, dreams of taking total control of the country's energy infrastructure and has been using Yamaji's ninja organization like a private military to force his agenda through. Determining that the clan had been corrupted beyond saving, Emma makes it her personal goal to stop them with Higan's help. She goes on a risky mission to infiltrate an AUZA facility and steal an energy tank for Higan's Gusoku Gear. Meanwhile, Jason and Mike are still on the run, but have the idea of using the computer in Emma's car as a way to continue their investigation. Thanks to that, Higan, Emma, Mike, and Jason are finally able to assemble in one place. Although Mike struggles to come to terms with the fact that Emma has been lying to him the whole time, the group unites with the common goal of bringing AUZA's conspiracy to light.",
