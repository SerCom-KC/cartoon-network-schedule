He needs to learn how to be a good sport.\" When Tom beats Tyke at a game of tic-tac-toe Tyke puts the \"sore\" into \"sore loser\" by biting Tom's finger when Tom extends it for a friendly post-game handshake. Tom forces Jerry to take turns playing various games with Tyke (e.g. Checkers, basketball, hopscotch, etc.). Each time they win, Tyke takes it out on them. When Tom and Jerry start throwing the games, Spike's right there to dole out his own punishment for letting Tyke win. Spike, \"I know! We'll play on teams. Me and Tyke against you twos. We'll show the boy how to be a good sport together.\" Sounds good in theory, but when Tom and Jerry beat Spike and Tyke they have double the trouble! Sometimes you just can't win!",

When Gumball objects he is told that even the smallest misdemeanor can lead to a breakdown in law. In an effort to impress the kids Donut Cop takes them for a ride-along in his cop car and gets carried away, progressively breaking the law himself. He soon proves that the tiniest offense can indeed snowball into complete lawlessness!  The Allergy: Gumball needs to find a cure for Darwin's allergy before he sneezes Elmore off the map. Darwin starts sneezing repeatedly and it seems he can't stop. The Wattersons figure maybe he's allergic to something. After a few guesses, they come to the conclusion that he is allergic to stupidity. Being surrounded by stupid people, this is something of a problem. And they need to find a solution before Darwin's increasingly explosive sneezes destroy the town.",
