In an effort to impress the kids Donut Cop takes them for a ride-along in his cop car and gets carried away, progressively breaking the law himself. He soon proves that the tiniest offense can indeed snowball into complete lawlessness!  The Allergy: Gumball needs to find a cure for Darwin's allergy before he sneezes Elmore off the map. Darwin starts sneezing repeatedly and it seems he can't stop. The Wattersons figure maybe he's allergic to something. After a few guesses, they come to the conclusion that he is allergic to stupidity. Being surrounded by stupid people, this is something of a problem. And they need to find a solution before Darwin's increasingly explosive sneezes destroy the town.",
