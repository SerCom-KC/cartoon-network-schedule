Although Joe skillfully defeats several of the invaders, he is fatally stabbed after seeing his wife and son get killed. Somehow surviving, Joe wakes up in a hospital where he is visited by FBI agents Mike and Emma, who ask for his help with their investigation. However, that night, more ninjas clad in black come to assault him. Joe fights back and kills them one after the other until only their boss is left, who tells Joe that the ninja organization will never stop hunting him. Joe leaves the hospital and returns to his home, which he burns to the ground. As the flames of vengeance consume him, his face no longer bears any resemblance to Joe Logan.",
