When Gumball and Darwin see Anton the next day, as good as new, they set out to discover his secret. It turns out that his parents use a special formula to bake new Antons when necessary. So the kids test it out at home and end up baking a clone army whose leader - Ant-one - wants to destroy Anton and take over the world.  The Puppy: The kids finally get the puppy they always wanted, except . . . it's actually a turtle, and it hates them. After begging Dad for a puppy, the kids are taken aback when he comes home with a turtle. Despite the fact that the turtle turns out to be extremely aggressive (especially toward Gumball) they try their best to give it the love it deserves. This achieves nothing. The Evil Turtle escapes and goes on a rampage, and they have to find it before it destroys Elmore.",
