        "summary_long": "When Zai was very young, he was caught and imprisoned by human traffickers, but later freed after Yamaji and the clan wiped out their syndicate. That was when Zai joined the ranks of the ninjas. He was emotionally scarred by the experience and developed a strong distrust of others, which didn't start to heal until he forged a friendship with Mari and Higan. However, Zai was left with an even greater scar upon his heart after those two abandoned the clan. Higan mourns Emma's death in the aftermath of the explosion when a letter challenging him to a duel arrives from Zai. Mike and Jason want to leak the top-secret data they hacked from AUZA to the public but discover they can't because Emma's external memory drive has encrypted it all. At the same time, AUZA gets the upper hand by having Emma, Mike, and Jason get reported as terrorists in the news. Mike decides to negotiate with his boss at the FBI to try and break the deadlock. Elsewhere, Higan and Zai begin their fated battle.",
